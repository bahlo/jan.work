Title: Elsewhere

Text:

Social networks or other sites that are similar in their shape and form come and go. I really want to focus on publishing a lot of things that are important to me here, on my own website.

I also have accounts elsewhere and if you want to interact with my there, please do. I'm always happy to interact with interesting humans. Here is a list of curated sites, where you can connect with me:
