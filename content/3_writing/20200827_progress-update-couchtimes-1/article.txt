Title: Progress Update: CouchTimes #1

----

Text:

Some weeks ago, I wrote about CouchTimes, the iOS TV show tracking application, I'm currently working on. In the past weeks, I did some progress on different angles of the application and I wanted to start sharing them more closely on this blog.

- I completely redid the search views from a technical standpoint
- The search now support more suggestions
- All detail view now lives inside a sheet
- Better data sharing inside the application with (link: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentobject text: @EnvironmentObject)
- Better image API handling â‡’ default to English localized covers and posters
- Much more little details

On top of everything, I also started to push new releases to (link: https://developer.apple.com/testflight/ text: TestFlight) now. If you are interested in joining this testing round, (email: support@couchtim.es text: please write a mail) (you need to run iOS 14).
