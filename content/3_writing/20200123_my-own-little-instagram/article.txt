Title: My own little Instagram

----

Text:

One year ago, I deleted my Instagram account. This step was one of the more significant ones in taking back control over my time and data. But removing Instagram from my life also left some empty space. This feeling is one of the reasons why I wanted to create a dedicated space for photography on this new site.

If you are visiting /photos, you can see a small collection of photos I took in the past weeks. This /photos section is built in the most fast and straightforward way. I don't rely on JavaScript. Everything based on static files and some (link: https://www.imgix.com text: imgix.com) optimization magic (I'm currently testing imgix.com for image optimization and delivery.

The overall feature-set of the /photos section is very limited at the moment. You can see a grid of photos and every single photo on a separate page. Still, I can imagine that things like albums, stories, private-commenting, and a better overall user experience will make this place my own little Instagram in the future.

It is mine. I own it, I built it and want to make it better in the future. In the meantime, feel free to subscribe to the photos-specific RSS feed.
