Title: Typography Test

----

Text:

Last week, I came across a subpage on (link: https://css-tricks.com text: css-tricks.com) called (link: https://css-tricks.com/typography-test/ text: Typography Test). I can't remember if it was a link or an article that guided me to this page, but it immediately triggered the feeling, "I need this for my new personal site."

With that feeling, I started building my very own simple typography testing page. I copied some sample HTML content into this page and added some media elements like an image and a YouTube video. Everything seemed fine, but adding a YouTube video to a page harms a fast-loading experience. I definitely don't want that.

Luckily, I came across a small little helper called (link: https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed text: Lite YouTube Embed) from (link: https://www.paulirish.com text: Paul Irish). Paul puts it like this:

> Provide videos with a supercharged focus on visual performance. This custom element renders just like the real thing but approximately 224X faster.

With the help of Lite YouTube Embed, this page (and every other page on this beautiful website) can render YouTube embeds like a ðŸš€ - which is incredible!

I'm happy with the first step towards a great typography (and other inline content elements) experience. As a next step, I want to add a bit more hierarchy and styling to the different elements. Besides that, I also want to invest more into a solid A11Y experience.
