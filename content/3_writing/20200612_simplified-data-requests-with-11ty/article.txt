Title: Simplified data requests with 11ty

----

Text:

In a previous post, I described my process of generating my /likes page. In its original shape and form, it needed a good amount of custom code to retrieve the data from the (link: https://pinboard.in/api/ text: Pinboard API). I also created a simple cache, which I mostly used to simplify my local development process, but it always felt like a hack.

Some weeks ago, I came across a new little 11ty utility that simplifies this whole process extremely. (link: https://twitter.com/zachleat text: Zach), the creator of (link: https://www.11ty.dev text: 11ty), published (link: https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-cache-assets text: eleventy-cache-assets) which basically does all the work, but in a much more elegant way.

After installing `eleventy-cache-assets` this is all the code I now need to archive the same functionality as before:

```js
const Cache = require("@11ty/eleventy-cache-assets");
require('dotenv').config();

const USERNAME = process.env.PINBOARD_USERNAME;
const PASSWORD = process.env.PINBOARD_PASSWORD;

module.exports = async function() {
  let json = await Cache(`https://${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}@api.pinboard.in/v1/posts/all?format=json&tag=like`, {
    duration: "1d",
    type: "json"
  });

  return json;
};
```

And to be fully clear, this is a much better system as before. Additionally, I also get a more robust and flexible caching system for free on top.

I also used the same utility to get the data I need for the little (link: https://dribbble.com text: Dribbble) preview I now have on my homepage. Just these few lines of code and everything works.

```js
const Cache = require("@11ty/eleventy-cache-assets");
require('dotenv').config();

const TOKEN = process.env.DRIBBBLE_TOKEN;

module.exports = async function() {
  let json = await Cache(`https://api.dribbble.com/v2/user/shots?per_page=6&access_token=${TOKEN}`, {
    duration: "1d",
    type: "json"
  });

  return json;
};
```

With the duration option you have full control over the duration timeframe of the cache itself. The type is extendable to other types like text or Buffer as well.

This utility really makes it a breeze to get data from an API and include it on your own website running 11ty.

### Update #1 - June 28th 2020

For some reason, the way I handled the Pinboard requests stopped working â€” I couldn't reproduce it myself. Thankfully, (link: https://arne.me text: Arne), who also used this setup came up with a (link: https://github.com/bahlo/arne.me/commit/039c0e96ffb7ea5a32d7cdc9bb26477757d03ccb text: fix) that solved the problem for us.
