Title: Weeknotes #1

----

Text:

With this post, I want to start something new. A weekly series that reflects on the things I‚Äôve learned, read or generally found interesting throughout the past week. This idea isn‚Äôt novel, (link: https://danmall.com/weeknotes/2021-05-02/ text: lots) (link: https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2019/05/weeknotes_17/ text: of) (link: https://arnesweekly.email text: people) are doing something like this in all kinds of different formats. While I wanted to avoid starting a separate newsletter for this ((link: https://fruechtl.me/feed text: RSS feeds) are still wonderful), I‚Äôve decided to use my default writing environment for this project. Let‚Äôs go‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶this first issue starts with CW 20, 2021.

### Design
- (link: https://spotify.design/article/better-in-black-rethinking-our-most-important-buttons text: Better in black: Rethinking our most important buttons) ‚Äî Interesting insights into the improvements Spotify is introducing around their user interface buttons. Better contrast and legibility will improve overall accessibility and user-friendliness. I can relate to the struggles around green and vividly remember similar discussions.
- (link: https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities/ text: Apple previews powerful software updates designed for people with disabilities) ‚Äî Lots of new accessibility features coming to Apple platforms. AssistiveTouch for Apple Watch was one of the highlights for me. Great to see more and more innovation in this space.
- A interesting (link: https://twitter.com/bartonsmith/status/1394796291738193920 text: Twitter thread) by Barton Smith around designing for Android
- (link: https://medium.com/tap-to-dismiss/a-better-segmented-control-9e662de2ef57 text: A better segmented control) ‚Äî Interesting summary about the approaches of Lyft's Design Systems team around segmented controls. Including a nice component deprecation trick for Figma component libraries. üòç

### Tech
- While I wasn‚Äôt too interested in all the (link: https://events.google.com/io/ text: Google I/O) topics, (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q13CishCKXY text: Project Starline was a highlight) for me.
- (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUQ2-C5ZNRc text: The new responsive: Web design in a component-driven world) ‚Äî Lots of interesting topics around new web technologies that help foster a component-driven mindset, like CSS (link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries text: Container Queries).
- (link: https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-4 text: Sublime Text 4) was released. While I use (link: https://vscodium.com/ text: VS Codium) for years now, Sublime was my daily driver before that. It's interesting to see what has changed, and I'm curious if it can become my daily driver again.

### Productivity
- (link: https://ugmonk.com/pages/analog text: Analog from Ugmonk) popped into my timeline again. This time I didn‚Äôt ignore it, but took a close look. While I find it very intriguing, it is pricey and knowing me, I only would use it for roughly a month anyway. Nevertheless, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it.

### Watched
- Watched the first season of (link: https://tv.apple.com/de/show/trying/umc.cmc.6muy4la7lj1omu5nci4bt2m66 text: Trying).
