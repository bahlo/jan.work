Title: Visual refresh

----

Text:

As mentioned in (link: /writing/restart-with-kirby text: my last post), let's dive a bit into the visual refresh this website got after moving it to (link: https://getkirby.com text: Kirby CMS).

## Simpler colors
While the last design was more fun with all the different color themes per page, it became a bit too much for me. Besides that, it also didn't scale very well. That's why I've decided to move back to a simpler color usage. Having a very light, non-white background and simple black and gray colors is enough for me at the current stage.

## Revised typography
I've also reverted some earlier typography experiments and went with a more common sans-serif for headings/serif for body text pairing. I've kept the beautiful (link: https://www.colophon-foundry.org/typefaces/apercu/ text: Aperçu) typeface, which now is used for headings, and added (link: https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/calluna/ text: Calluna) for everything concerning body text.

There is still room for some size and spacing improvements, but so far, I'm delighted with the current state.

## Portfolio and case studies
A more prominent addition was the rebirth of my portfolio section. The last version of my personal site didn't have a dedicated page to list or showcase projects I've worked on. This portfolio section now has two clear purposes:

1. Showcase some case studies that go deeper into past projects
2. List different other project I do on the side to form a more full picture

Everything besides the individual case studies follow the same subtle vibe of simple black and gray text paired with a solid typography hierarchy. As the case studies should get a bit more prominence, I've wrapped them into their own card-based object. These cards are also the starting point for case-study-based color themes. Every case study gets its own color theme — not as extreme as the old bold color themes, but some sprinkles help.

A bit after I've released the first update, I rediscovered a (link: https://css-tricks.com/stacked-cards-with-sticky-positioning-and-a-dash-of-sass/ text: post on CSS-Tricks) I've saved on my Instapaper some weeks back. This post described a stacked cards effect on (link: https://corey.ginnivan.net text: Corey Ginnivan’s website), which I found so cool I needed to create the same on my case study section (full transparency where this idea originated).

## Miscellaneous
Besides these three main points, there were also some other changes:
- Removed the /likes page (a place to showcase cool bookmarks)
- Added a like button to individual posts (only I can see the like amount; the button increases the amount on every individual click)
- You can still access the older version under different subdomains
  - (link: https://2020.fruechtl.me text: 2020.fruechtl.me)
  - (link: https://2018.fruechtl.me text: 2018.fruechtl.me)
- Added support for a (link: https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-a-skip-to-content-link/ text: Skip to Content) link
- Used `<details>` and `<summary>` in the experience section under /about (better a11y and no JavaScript needed)

I'll keep iterating on different smaller areas, but this was a high-level overview what I did with this site, besides moving to (link: https://getkirby.com text: Kirby CMS). Additionally, feel free to take a look at the (link: https://github.com/coolcut/fruechtl.me text: source code on GitHub).
