Text:

It's the second week of my new Weeknotes journey. Let's see what I've got today:

### Design
- (link: https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/responsive-design-at-11-container-queries/ text: Responsive design and container queries? Oh my!) is a high-level view on the new and upcoming container queries. Looking forward to broader browser support for this!

- (link: https://hector.me/hej text: Hej â€” Color-matched desktop wallpapers) is yet another beautiful wallpaper kit by (link: https://hector.me text: Hector Simpson). While this set is designed to match the new iMacs, it's a general great evolution to his previous wallpaper set called (link: https://hector.me/aqueux text: Aqueux).

### Shameless Plug
