Title: My digital stack

----

Text:

In the past, I was always a big fan of “What's in my bag” posts or videos. Not a lot is more interesting to me seeing how others structure their work and gear they use daily.

This is a collection of the digital tools I use on a near daily basis:

## Design

### (link: https://www.figma.com text: Figma)
My primary product design tool for some years and use daily to do my work.

### (link: https://www.loom.com text: Loom)
Asynchronous communication is essential in a remote work setup. Loom makes it easy and comfortable to record quick video explanations about challenges, ideas, or updates to share with my team.

### (link: https://usecontrast.com text: Contrast)
A tiny little macOS application to quickly access to (link: https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/ text: WCAG) color contrast ratios.

### (link: https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/ text: Sim Daltonism)
Sim Daltonism is a great too to visualize colors as they are perceived with various types of color blindness.

### (link: https://eagle.cool text: Eagle)
The place where I save visual references or inspiration for later use.

## Development

### (link: https://code.visualstudio.com text: VS Code)
My code editor of choice — nothing more, nothing less.

### (link: https://www.netlify.com text: Netlify)
The place where I host most of the sites I have on the web (this one is the exception). It's just very fast, simple and a joy to use.

### (link: https://getkirby.com text: Kirby)
The CMS that powers this very site.

### (link: https://www.11ty.dev text: 11ty)
For all other sites I have on the web, I use 11ty as my static site generator of choice. Fast, simple and just beautiful to use.

### (link: https://plausible.io text: Plausible)
Tiny little analytics tool my websites. Made and hosted in the EU. 100% self-funded and independent.

## Productivity

### (link: https://obsidian.md text: Obsidian)

### (link: https://culturedcode.com/things/ text: Things)
Currently, my getting things done app of choice. So simple, so beautiful, and it has everything for me to get things done.

### (link: https://www.raycast.com text: Raycast)
A fancier and way more powerful macOS Spotlight alternative.

### (link: https://fig.io text: Fig)
I love the terminal and CLI tools, but I often struggle with using the correct commands. Fig adds autocomplete support into my terminal, which not only makes me a fast terminal users but I also learn commands way better.

### (link: https://languagetool.org text: LanguageTool)


## Reading

### (link: https://netnewswire.com text: NetNewsWire)
A free and open-source RSS reader I use daily. With iCloud sync enabled, this is all I need from RSS.

### (link: https://www.instapaper.com text: Instapaper)
Everything I want to revisit or read later gets sent into Instapaper first. Based on this backlog, I decide if I want to read or bookmark it.

### (link: https://readwise.io text: Readwise)
One of the best tools I've found in the past years. It not only saves highlights from books or articles, but also can handle tweet threads or other media.

## Miscellaneous

### (link: https://cleanshot.com text: Cleanshot)
One of the best mac utiltiies out there for screenshots, annotations and much more.

### (link: https://www.macbartender.com text: Bartender)
Tiny menu bar is the best menu bar.

### (link: https://1password.com text: 1Password)
S👏A👏F👏E👏 P👏A👏S👏S👏W👏O👏R👏D👏S

### (link: https://www.spotify.com text: Spotify)
While I'm not really a playlist person, Spotify just works better for me when it comes to suggestions or Release Radar.

### (link: https://overcast.fm text: Overcast)
I listed to many podcasts and Overcast gives me the best listening experience.

### (link: https://pi-hole.net text: Pi-Hole)

### (link: https://signal.org text: Signal)
My messenger of choice next to iMessage.

### (link: https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/ text: Tweetbot)
My default Twitter app across all platforms. It's efficient and beautiful, not much more to say.

### (link: https://moneymoney-app.com text: MoneyMoney)
Most of the time, interfaces from banks aren't a great experience. MoneyMoney is a fast and native Mac application that connects to almost all German banks (at least all banks I use) and makes all basic interactions with your bank account easy and enjoyable.
