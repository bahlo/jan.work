Title: Visual refresh

----

Text:

As mentioned in (link: /writing/restart-with-kirby text: my last post), let's dive a bit into the visual refresh this website got after moving it to (link: https://getkirby.com text: Kirby CMS).

## Simpler colors
While the last design was more fun with all the different color themes per page, it became a bit too much for me. Besides that, it also didn't scale very well. That's why I've decided to move back to a simpler color usage. Having a very light, non-white background and simple black and gray colors will be enough paired with a solid typography hierarchy.

## Revised typography
I've also reverted some earlier typography experiments and went with a more clear sans-serif for headings, serif for body text pairing. I kept the beautiful (link: https://www.colophon-foundry.org/typefaces/apercu/ text: Aperçu) typeface, which now is used for headings, and added (link: https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/calluna/ text: Calluna) for everything around body text.

There is still the need for a bit of size and spacing improvements here and there, but so far, I'm delighted with the setup.

## Portfolio and case studies
An addition to the visual refresh was the rebirth of my portfolio section on this website. The past version of my personal site didn't have any dedicated page to list or showcase project I've worked on. This section has two clear purposed:

1. Showcase some case studies that go deeper into some past projects I've worked on at different companies
2. List different other project I do on the side to form a full picture to what I'm currently doing

Everything besides the individual case studies follow the same subtle vibe of simple black and gray text paired with a solid typography hierarchy. As the case studies should get a bit more prominence, I've wrapped them into their own card-based object. 

A bit after I've released the first update, I rediscovered a (link: https://css-tricks.com/stacked-cards-with-sticky-positioning-and-a-dash-of-sass/ text: post on CSS-Tricks) I save on Instapaper. This post described a stacked cards effect on (link: https://corey.ginnivan.net text: Corey Ginnivan’s website), which I found so cool I needed to create the same here (full transparency).

## Miscellaneous
- I removed the /likes page (a place to showcase cool bookmarks)
- Added a like button to individual posts (only I can see the like amount and the button increases the amount on every individual click)
- You can still access the older version under different subdomains
  - (link: https://2020.fruechtl.me text: 2020.fruechtl.me)
  - (link: https://2018.fruechtl.me text: 2018.fruechtl.me)
- Added support for (link: https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-a-skip-to-content-link/ text: Skip to Content) link
- Used `<details>` and `<summary>` experience section (better a11y and no JavaScript needed)
