### Development
- (link: https://twitter.com/TechSquidTV/status/1398637757992423425 text: A graphic explaining different array methods in JavaScript) — Quite like these kinds of visual learning graphics.

### Reading
- (link: https://stratechery.com/2021/passport/ text: Passport) — Ben Thompson, author of my favorite newsletter (link: https://stratechery.com text: Stratechery), released Passport to support his and other independent subscription businesses. Open protocols are the focus here.
- (link: https://medium.com/inclusive-research text: A Practical Guide to Inclusive Research) — A great collection on how to improve your UX Research practice.
- (link: https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook text: Apple employees push back against returning to the office in internal letter) — The next months will be interesting with probably more and more "return to the office" requests from companies. Apple employees are pushing back.

### Sparkles
- (link: https://brianlovin.com/stack text: Stack - My favorite tools and software) — Cool subpage more personal websites should have. All the tools and software (link: https://brianlovin.com text: Brian Lovin) is using.
- (link: https://notes.arne.me text: Arnes notes) — Love the project Arne has been working on for the past weeks. Creating a place where all his public knowledge and notes live. Similar to (link: https://notes.andymatuschak.org text: Andy Matuschak's notes).
- (link: https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history text: A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden) — Following the approach mentioned above about Arnes notes, this is a summary about the idea of digital gardening. Digital gardens are a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organized.
