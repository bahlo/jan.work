Motus itself is an industry and logistics software platform with a focus on fast, safe and more transparent logistic processes. The warehouse product was one of the critical building blocks towards the company goal of building more intuitive solutions for the entire logistics industry.<\/p><p>The motus web application is primarily focused on managing different kinds of master records while maintaining the entire logistics process itself.&nbsp;To meet the needs of our users and the market, we needed to come up with a solution that can work on as many devices and operating systems as possible, while being flexible, user-friendly and accessible in many scenarios.<\/p><p>During the development process, we came across different obstacles we successfully mastered. From my point of view, one key factor that contributed to the success of this initial iteration of the motus warehouse product was our component-based approach during the design and development of our user interface. This approach allowed us to move quickly while also building an in-depth documentation and internal design system that grew slowly but steadily.<\/p><p>Furthermore, we gathered a lot of positive feedback and success stories during our own testing rounds. This open and continuous feedback loop was a crucial part during our development phase.<\/p>"},"id":"14781b60-5b2f-4443-8fdc-1a2690ef3404","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Challenge"},"id":"74207624-19ac-4d97-a962-69e381992c27","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The logistics software market tends to be slow, conservative and principally offers isolated software solutions. Our approach with motus was the complete opposite. We wanted to build a generic base with modular, extendable plugins while always keeping a user-focused approach.<\/p><p>Furthermore, our users generally are under immense stress and have to work quickly to meet the high rates of a successful logistics company. Tasks, like editing master records, overlooking statistics, and composing reports, have to be done as effective as possible and we needed to optimize for these specific use-cases.<\/p>"},"id":"579f6825-792a-49a8-b312-c7792d741485","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Approach"},"id":"3e801c43-2335-4caa-9849-db130bd13a9e","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>To handle all these different challenges successfully and be as beneficial to our users as possible, we built different prototypes and kept a close communication line to our customers to get their feedback early on. These prototypes were mostly static web applications that incorporated different ideas about fast and error-prone master record management.<\/p><p>Early on, we also thought about introducing a component-based development approach. At first, we wanted to free up resources and speed up our overall development process, but at a second thought, we also saw the benefit in documenting user-interfaces.<\/p>"},"id":"1354467e-2052-4392-9301-e731bccffbb4","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Implementation"},"id":"c8517677-e7cf-4838-ad38-9b9081697870","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>In our product development team, I was mainly responsible for the design process as well as the implementation of these designs as a frontend developer - the frontend development part was only through the first year.
