Before \u201cServices\u201d, BRYTER was a great tool for creating tools to automate processes and get knowledge from experts into a piece of software that could be used by others later on. The addition of \u201cServices\u201d not only added a simpler grouping mechanism for related BRYTER modules (the name of software pieces created with BRYTER), but also add additional functionality (e.g. case databases) that enables customers to do entirely new and more powerful things.<\/p>"},"id":"550419b7-d2be-46d6-a085-da0c91ca9dcb","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Challenge"},"id":"c4e76179-48af-4275-bea0-36bc4cbf4cbf","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>In the beginning, nobody really knew what we wanted or needed to make the lives of our customers easier, enable them to do more powerful things and bring the BRYTER platform to a new level. We needed to preserve the easy way to get started with BRYTER, while also extending the capabilities and setting the platform up for rapid extensibility and more complexity.<\/p><p>Balancing these two factors were one of the most critical parts in understanding and uncovering what we needed to build to enable our customers to do even more powerful things.<\/p>"},"id":"7c3baddf-71fc-44b4-81f1-fb6cfb0f50f9","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Approach"},"id":"5daf0b78-facd-4a66-be37-2e197fe6c34a","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Together as a pair with the lead product manager for this project, <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.yangmeyer.de\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yang Meyer Reifenrath<\/a>, we went ahead outlining and prototyping different potential focus areas of the foggy ideas everybody had in their minds. In the first weeks, starting like this really helped bring more and more stakeholders together in seeing common patterns and aligning on a still abstract idea.<\/p><p>We had numerous conversation with all the key stakeholders across the whole company. It wasn't uncommon at this early stages of the project to change some key element of the current direction on a weekly basis. It felt like a rollercoaster ride, but one that seemed to make actual progress. Numerous prototypes, whiteboarding sessions, interviews, and stakeholder discussions later we had a more clear idea on how something might come together at the end.<\/p>"},"id":"a691593f-f588-45b4-bb49-bb22f8c389b5","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Implementation"},"id":"847a4f16-bb21-4e7f-9c95-b2aac7b9242a","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":""},"id":"3e9688ee-954c-42f4-916f-859b436dc215","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Outcome"},"id":"62897b8a-6289-4776-802b-f9250afafd84","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>After leading the design of this project from the beginning and doing a lot of early exploration and design, I handed the project over to my amazing colleague <a href=\"https:\/\/jengoertzen.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jen Goertzen<\/a> at the ~ 80% mark to <a href=\"\/portfolio\/bliss-design-system-v1-x\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">focus again on our Design System<\/a>. From this point, Jen led this project until the initial release and continued working on additional new features after that.<\/p><p>With both of our contributions to the initial release of Services, we saw a great and fast adoption to a whole new area of BRYTER. Services not only improved the way of organizing the modules our customers build with BRYTER, they also opened entirely new areas to explore and use \u2014 like case databases.<\/p>"},"id":"06a08ecd-491f-4327-b86f-cea6da08a081","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"What I\u2019ve learned"},"id":"d27e0df1-d789-4127-a2bc-8ae88eb74cd7","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>In hindsight, it's probably fair to say that in the beginning this was one of the most unclear and open projects I've worked on so far. There was a rough idea about something and with countless questions asked, creating early prototypes and ideas we were able to communicate and align more and more with our founders, stakeholders, and customers.<\/p><p>At some point during the process, I decided to create a whole HTML-based prototype which was 90% based on our Design Systems foundation to feedback sessions even more straightforward and also reuse some created bits during development later one. While I was not sure in the beginning if this time invest would be worth it, it played out very nicely. Testing sessions were even more detailed and fun and developers were able to leverage some of the prototype parts which speeded up their work immensely.<\/p><p>I also learned and experienced many ways to improve the overall hand-off process and how to illustrate some common stress cases of designing for the web directly in these hand-off documents. In the end, this hand-off flow resulted in a Design Review checklist designs now use during their work.<\/p>"},"id":"8953b4b9-d670-48ba-8442-82a45e7ee5a8","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
