This needed to be changed! So, my team and I started thinking about possible solutions for this highly requested feature.<\/p><p>In Germany, the official advance VAT return document from the German fiscal authority is very complex, large and often feels cumbersome.\u00a0The goals with our implementation were to make it feel simple, fast, and easy to use. To do this in a first iteration, we decided only to support the majority of all possible VAT use cases and ignored small stress-cases which are the reason for the complexity of the official document.<\/p><p>In a short amount of time, we conceptualized, designed, tested and developed this feature for our customers. Every step in this process was filled with different feedback loops, as well as internal and external user-testing rounds for gathering real-life feedback from our customers.<\/p>"},"id":"c780f411-1d6a-4d54-9a68-4f3d9ef017db","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Challenge"},"id":"c6b0a5dd-4296-4440-b20e-16ec19787926","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Everything that is relating to official fiscal authorities can feel a bit dangerous or threatening. Our primary challenge for this feature was to make the process simple, fast and easy to use.<\/p><p>It would be crucial for us always to communicate possible actions or misleading entries to our users. This communication would make the overall process more transparent, easy to understand, and hopefully increase trust in our product.<\/p>"},"id":"d5918e88-4984-450c-9e27-b69eb64f9e6c","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Approach"},"id":"21c462fb-0e10-4cc7-83e5-4bb639c37ffa","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Early in the process, we set out some hypothesis we needed to validate before moving into a more detail-oriented design phase.

One of the keys to the success of this project was the idea of a multistep form flow.\u00a0This idea seemed logical because we could split-up the complexity in smaller and manageable junks of information. This implementation would make the process more transparent and easy to understand.<\/p><p>We iterated and tested small prototypes with this idea in mind. After seeing the evident success of these prototypes, we quickly moved into a more detail-oriented phase of visual design.<\/p>"},"id":"12304e03-bf95-41f2-8f22-c687a3603f64","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["ust-va-history.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"Screenshot from a list showing all previous advance VAT return processes.","caption":"All the past transmissions will be displayed in this table.","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"e9745a22-befb-4890-8f52-2ae01d7852d3","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["ust-va-form-step-two.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"Screenshot from the second step during the process of the advance VAT return, which focuses on the revenue declarations.","caption":"The second screen of our three-step form.

As a result of that, potential mistakes will become visible before it is too late. With this information in mind, everybody can make an informed decision about submitting the entered data to the fiscal authorities.

Occasionally, it is hard to cut beloved features or improvements because they are not going to make it for the upcoming release. But as long as everything moves in small and steady improvement cycles, it will pay off eventually.
