With a small new team of three (two frontend engineers plus me), we began taking inventory of the current state of Bliss and started planning the future.<\/p><p>With the goal of moving the component library of Bliss to a JavaScript-based foundation, we quickly moved ahead in building an early proof of concept and shipped the <a href=\"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/bliss-design-system\/iconsets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">first toolkit for Bliss Icons<\/a> to our consumers.<\/p><p>Coupled with numerous feedback session with stakeholders across engineering, design and product management, we landed on moving forward and build our new JavaScript-based components as <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/Web_Components\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Web Components<\/a>.

Every component we migrate to Web Components went under a detailed rethink and usage analyses. All this happened together with the design team and numerous feedback and design critique sessions.<\/p><p>Besides some visual adjustments, our primary focus was on improving the accessibility of each component.

To make the whole experience about adding a new item to the proposal board a breeze, we added multiple different issue templates including structure and examples to choose from.<\/p>"},"id":"8cb43306-dc2b-45b4-8b59-711cbf44fa2f","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h3","text":"Open Office Hours"},"id":"7d47d2d3-3d08-45cc-9fdb-a3b527ee1eb8","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>We also offered fortnightly office hours where stakeholders could join and discuss different problems or solution with us.

This method not only incremented our overall adoption, but also increased the understanding of Bliss Components across teams, as engineers still needed to review merge requests and learned different ways of using Bliss through review.<\/p>"},"id":"f39518fc-aa26-4fb1-9cfc-879754c901ee","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Bliss Ambassadors"},"id":"8296162d-3d00-4599-beb0-af3d943993fb","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The product area of BRYTER operates in numerous cross-functional teams, called \u201cUnits\u201d. All of these units consume Bliss, or different parts of Bliss, regularly. In these kinds of setups, with a fast growth in new joiners, communication channels can lose their power from time to time. As everybody focuses on achieving the goals of their units, it is sometimes difficult to give feedback or react to us requesting feedback from different teams. <\/p><p>We felt the slow and steady decline of our communication channel and needed to take a different approach to inform units on an equal level.<\/p><p>This is where the idea of Bliss Ambassadors comes into play. We created a forum for people to become Bliss Ambassadors for their unit. This meant that we had a direct contact person in every unit we could talk to, without running into the \u201ctalking into the void\u201d problem. We also started to organize fortnightly <em>Bliss Ambassador Syncs<\/em>, where every ambassador joins a 30-minute call. In this call, ambassadors get the hottest updates from the Bliss team and have space to share the latest struggles of feedback from their unit.<\/p>"},"id":"1fd36878-73f5-42ed-ba62-7d8f2802b105","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"What I've learned"},"id":"3cd799a8-6224-430b-9eaf-7242ab69627e","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Communication and documentation are the two primary cornerstones of a successful design system. We tried to over-communicate and open up more and more different kind of communication channels, so information could easily reach others.

It also can sometimes feel like a thankless job. This should by no means feel like a negative realization, but a realistic one. <\/p><p>As design systems teams, we can only do so much. Keeping communication flowing, building trustful relationships with consumers and stakeholders, and setting clear boundaries and expectations are the most important pieces.
