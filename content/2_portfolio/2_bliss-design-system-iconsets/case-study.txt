Consolidating and systemising the iconset we use at BRYTER through our design system Bliss was the goal for this project. Based on the previous icons in use and the brand direction we chose for the BRYTER brand, we decided to create a system to create a harmonious icon style we can use across the product and brand.<\/p><p>While the focus in the beginning of this project was on the actual icon system and design of the individual icons, we later also created toolkits and components for developers to consume these icons in the most straightforward way possible.<\/p><p>My main role during this project was to lead the initiative, co-create the system behind our new icon style and manage stakeholders and feedback sessions. While this project was huge team effort across different teams, I want to mention the key collaborators Nina K\u00f6nig, Bozana and Gabrielle von Koss.<\/p>"},"id":"7e80e9fe-c194-4c4e-aa74-b9274446fb37","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Inventory and explorations"},"id":"06235031-b6fa-4d60-abf7-ccab4cdffd30","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>As with most redesigns, it often start with a detailed inventory of the current state. The same was true for us. We not only went through the current set of icons we used inside our Figma library, but also compiled a huge set of examples inside our production application.<\/p><p>One of the most prominent theme me surfaced was the amount of different sizes we used for icons. Across the application, we used over 15 different sizes for icons, ranging from 9x9 to 35x35. This was something we want to simplify and restrict with the redesign.<\/p><p>Besides that, we also compiled all the different stylistic adjustments that the current icons in use accumulated over time. Without a clear system and guidelines, every new icon looked a bit different.<\/p><p>After the foundational inventory Bozana, Nina and I did a lot of exploration rounds followed by feedback rounds with different other teams and designers. While Nina did most of the actual creation work, I tried to keep an overview over the process and systematic approach behind the creation of the different icons and how it all might come together in the end.<\/p>"},"id":"4be9a72b-3531-45f0-bcca-81d6c773f5cd","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Documentation and contribution"},"id":"ee19ed3f-8735-4e44-83c3-a66d05a61933","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>After the initial release of our icons, designers at BRYTER were keen on using the new shiny iconset.<\/p>"},"id":"16620b63-42bc-4502-8bcc-855f78c27a62","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
