Consolidating and systemizing the iconset we use at BRYTER was the goal of this redesign project. Based on our previous iconset and the general brand direction of BRYTER, we decided to create a system to create a harmonious icon style across our product and brand.<\/p><p>While the focus at the beginning of this project was on the actual icon system and design of the individual icons, we later also developed toolkits for developers to consume these new icons in a more straightforward way.<\/p><p>My role during this project was to lead the overall initiative, co-create the system behind our new icon style and manage stakeholders and feedback sessions.

We not only went through the current set of icons in use, but also compiled a huge set of examples inside our production application for later comparison.<\/p><p>One of the most prominent subjects we surfaced was the amount of different icon sizes we used. Across the BRYTER application, we used over 15 different sizes - ranging from 9px to 30px. Additionally, not all icon frames had the same aspect ratio. Some icon frames were squares, some were rectangles. This was something we set out to simplify with the redesign.<\/p><p>After the foundational inventory Bozana, Nina and I did different exploration rounds followed by feedback sessions with different teams and designers at BRYTER. While Nina did most of the actual icon creation work, I tried to keep an overview over the process and systematic approach behind the creation of the different icons and how it all might come together in the end.<\/p>"},"id":"4be9a72b-3531-45f0-bcca-81d6c773f5cd","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["icon-explorations.png"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Some early explorations from different icons we needed for the iconset","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"6bc61cce-18a7-4237-b599-0293e3021579","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Creation and Testing"},"id":"be73fb51-19a6-4421-8db9-16bff0945071","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The actual creation of the new icons was a lot of trial and error.

To document our new process and also enable everybody to actively contribute to our new iconset, we published guidelines around our new icon design language.<\/p><p>One key aspect of the icon system is the difference between the bounding box and the icon content. While the bounding box describes the absolute size of every icon, the icon content focuses on the actual drawn icon itself and its ideal size based on its proportions. This means that designers and developers always plan with an icon size of 24x24 and don't need to care about the actual size of the drawn icon - which could be 14x14, 16x16 or some \"one-off stress case\" depending on different factors like visual weight.<\/p><p>The sizing rule and our straightforward icon grid makes the usage of these icons predictable and produces more consistent results during the creation of new icons.<\/p>"},"id":"16620b63-42bc-4502-8bcc-855f78c27a62","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["iconsets-guideline.png"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Documentation with all the guidelines we established for creating icon","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"6ca365f7-ea18-4690-a1d7-206595f4f26b","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Learnings"},"id":"77bff088-7e66-4927-99b3-30bef70f6851","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>While the initial push for the big icon redesign project came from the product teams, the icons are now used across the company at BRYTER (some examples can be found on the <a href=\"https:\/\/bryter.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">BRYTER website<\/a>). Besides that positive side effect, I also learned once again that you don't have to have all the answers, but you need to always improve and listen to potential pain-points of the people you're supporting.<\/p><p>Additionally, it became clear to us that the source of truth of the Iconset needs to be inside the codebase.
