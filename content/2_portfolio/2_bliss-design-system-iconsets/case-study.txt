Consolidating and systemizing the Iconset we use at BRYTER through our design system Bliss was the goal for this project. Based on the previous icons we used and the brand direction we chose for the BRYTER brand, we decided to create a system to create a harmonious icon style we can use across the product and brand.<\/p><p>While the focus at the beginning of this project was on the actual icon system and design of the individual icons, we later also created toolkits and components for developers to consume these icons in the most straightforward way possible.<\/p><p>My main role during this project was to lead the initiative, co-create the system behind our new icon style and manage stakeholders and feedback sessions. While this project was a huge team effort across different teams, I want to mention the key collaborators <a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/ninakoenig\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Nina K\u00f6nig<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/bozana\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Bozana Bozic<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/gvonkoss.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Gabrielle von Koss<\/a>.<\/p>"},"id":"7e80e9fe-c194-4c4e-aa74-b9274446fb37","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Inventory and explorations"},"id":"06235031-b6fa-4d60-abf7-ccab4cdffd30","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>As with most redesigns, it often starts with a detailed inventory of the current state. We not only went through the current set of icons we used, but also compiled a huge set of examples inside our production application.<\/p><p>One of the most prominent theme we surfaced was the amount of different sizes we used for icons. Across the BRYTER application, we used over 15 different sizes for icons, ranging from 9px to 30px. Additionally, not all icon frames had the same aspect ratio. Some icon frames were squares, some were rectangles. This was something we want to simplify and restrict with the redesign as well.<\/p><p>Besides that, we also compiled all the different stylistic adjustments that the current icons in use accumulated over time. Without a clear system and guidelines, every new icon we've created for new features looked a bit different and consistency more and more suffered.<\/p><p>After the foundational inventory Bozana, Nina and I did different exploration rounds followed by feedback rounds with different other teams and designers. While Nina did most of the actual icon creation work, I tried to keep an overview over the process and systematic approach behind the creation of the different icons and how it all might come together in the end.<\/p>"},"id":"4be9a72b-3531-45f0-bcca-81d6c773f5cd","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Creation and testing"},"id":"be73fb51-19a6-4421-8db9-16bff0945071","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The actual creation of the new icons was a lot of trial and error. We tried to keep a close communication channel to different kind of teams and stakeholders and also encouraged them to play around with different icons we already created.<\/p><p>This collaboration helped us immensely in finding different stress cases for our new icon system. We also created all kind of different Before &amp; After screens to discussion and analyze our overall direction.<\/p>"},"id":"da00ad9f-e7b7-4fa8-8109-4512d653a77a","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["iconset-old-new.png"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":null,"link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"548c9232-4b97-4d93-af5a-38f3e8c9d195","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>After all the design focused work and the initial release of the design source of the new icons, the design systems team around Bliss needed to come up with a solution to make the usage of these new icons. Based on this we've decided two create two solutions that if used together make the usage of our Iconset straightforward - most of the technical implementation was done by Gabi.<\/p>"},"id":"7e488c04-d350-46cd-89b1-d47740b62511","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h4","text":"<a href=\"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/bliss-design-system\/iconsets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Bliss Iconsets toolkit<\/a>"},"id":"4cd56109-f419-46cf-957d-b4d3873d8efd","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The single source of truth for Bliss icons, from a design and a development perspective.

To document our new process and also enable everybody to actively contribute to our new Iconset, we published some guidelines around our new icon language.<\/p><p>One key aspect of the icon system is the different between the bounding box and the icon content. While the bounding box describes the absolute size of every icon, the icon content focuses on the actual drawn icon itself and its ideal size based on its proportions. This means that designers and developer always plan with an icon size of 24x24 and don't need to care about the actual size of the drawn icon - which could be 14x14 or 16x16 depending on different factors like visual weight.<\/p><p>The sizing rule and our straightforward icon grid makes the usage of these icons predictable and makes is more consistent during the creation of new icons.<\/p>"},"id":"16620b63-42bc-4502-8bcc-855f78c27a62","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["iconsets-guideline.png"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":null,"link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"6ca365f7-ea18-4690-a1d7-206595f4f26b","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Learnings"},"id":"77bff088-7e66-4927-99b3-30bef70f6851","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor<\/p>"},"id":"dacaebb6-cda2-4c17-8232-717a6a5f448a","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
