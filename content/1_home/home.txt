Intro:

My natural habitat is at the intersection of design and engineering. With over seven years of experience in product design, this is where I feel most effective to support the teams I collaborate with.

I'm a systems thinker who enjoys building scalable solutions while asking numerous questions, trying to understand the context of the given problem space as much as possible. I love elegant user experiences and care deeply about inclusive design and accessible solutions that are built for all people.

When I'm not working, I co-host the (link: https://sprachnachrichten.fm text: Sprachnachrichten) podcast, which is focused on productivity and self-improvement in the digital age. Besides that, I also work on different side projects like (link: https://couchtim.es text: CouchTimes).

If you're interested in getting in touch, you can find me on (link: https://twitter.com/_coolcut text: Twitter), or on (link: https://github.com/coolcut text: GitHub) where I work on my side projects in the open, or you are welcome to (email: hey@jan.work text: email me).
